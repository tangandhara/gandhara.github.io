I chose to focus on the mean values in difference between hourly and bonus pay across genders for each entry.\n\nTo do this, I took the relevant mean values and post codes and essentially performed a lookup with a separate dataset of UK postcodes to obtain the local authority names. This dataframe was combined with a shapefile of UK local authorities. I was then able to summarise the data using the mean value in the differences per local authority.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis approach does have limitations, specifically by using mean values per local authority results in data that is not standardised. Neverthless, the intention of this small project was to put together a visualisation rather than conduct an in-depth analysis of the data.\n\n### R Code\n\nThe full code is available on GitHub by clicking [here](https://github.com/tangandhara/Portfolio/tree/main/UK%20Pay%20Gap).\n\n![UK Paygap Data](Paygap_plot.jpg){fig-alt=\"Two plots showing regional pay gap differences in the UK\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"1000\"}\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"journal","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Gender Pay Gap","author":"Tan Gandhara","categories":["dataviz","visualisation"],"subtitle":"Choropleth maps visualising pay gaps in the UK"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
